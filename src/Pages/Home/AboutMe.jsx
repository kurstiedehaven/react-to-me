            Lemme tell you a little bit about myself. I have been attending the UNC Fullstack Web Developer Bootcamp.
            I have been learning a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and React.
            I have been enjoying the process of learning and creating new things. I am excited to see what the future holds for me.
            I am excited to see what I can create and what I can learn in the future.
